# Surfs-Up-Challenge

## Purpose
- The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate weather trends based on temperature on the island of Oahu. Using SQLite data run queries to get the statistical anaysis of both the months of June and December. With this analysis we can determine if an ice cream and surf shop would be viable all year round. 

### Results
- June Temperatures

- December Temperatures

- When comparing the data from June and December there are several interesting findings.
1. Both the June and December temperatures have an average temperature above 70 degrees. June having an average temp of 74.94 degrees and December with an average of 71.04 degrees. 
2. They also both have a similar max temperature of just over 80 degrees. June has a max temperature of 85 degrees and December has 83 degrees.
3. The biggest difference is in count of temperatures for each month. June has a count of 1700 where December has a count of 1517. Both have a sample size above 1500 readings of temperature and I am happy with that sample size for this analysis. 

#### Summary
-In summary I have found that the analysis has a couple of key takeaways for the investors. June on average has higher temperatures making an ice cream surf shop viable during the summer months. December does have a lower average temperature but still warm enough to encourge ice cream sales and surf sales during the winter months. Both have realtivly similar max temperatures meaning that even in the winter months Oahu still can have hot days. All in all it does appear that an ice cream surf shop hybrid store would be a viable business on the island of Oahu. I would recommend doing one store to start and gather data from that store to determine if expansion to other islands is a viable option in the future.
